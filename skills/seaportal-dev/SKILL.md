# SeaPortal Development

SeaPortal is a Go CLI that fetches a URL and emits clean Markdown / a JSON
accessibility snapshot, classifying pages as static / ssr / dynamic / spa /
hydrated / blocked. HTTP-only — for JS-heavy pages, escalate to pinchtab.

## Project Location

```bash
cd ~/dev/prj/pinchtab/seaportal
```

## Dev Commands

All development commands run via `./dev`:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `./dev build` | Build the application |
| `./dev run` | Build & run with test URL |
| `./dev check` | All checks (format, vet, lint, test) |
| `./dev test` | Run unit tests |
| `./dev test race` | Run tests with race detector |
| `./dev coverage` | Run tests with coverage |
| `./dev lint` | Run golangci-lint |
| `./dev fmt` | Format code |
| `./dev vet` | Run go vet |
| `./dev fuzz` | Run fuzz tests (30s) |
| `./dev bench [sub]` | Build + run seabench (`./dev bench help` for subcommands) |
| `./dev opt baseline` | Run the scripted optimization lane |
| `./dev e2e` | E2E tests (Docker) |
| `./dev smoke` | Smoke tests (slow fixture suite) |
| `./dev all` | check + test + e2e (pre-push gate) |
| `./dev doctor` | Check dev environment |
| `./dev install skills` | Symlink `./skills` into `./.claude/skills` |

## Pre-push gate

`./dev all` is the canonical pre-push gate:

1. `check` — gofmt, go vet, go build, golangci-lint
2. `test` — full unit suite (with `-count=1`)
3. `e2e` — Docker-based scenarios in `tests/e2e/`

Anything that touches `internal/engine/extract.go` should also run
`./dev bench eval` to confirm no regression on the corpus.

## Adding a feature

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` (regression-test-per-fix convention applies).
2. Add a regression test FIRST (see `// regression: <slug>` markers in the
   codebase for prior art).
3. Implement.
4. Re-run `./dev all`. Run `./dev bench eval` if extraction was touched.
5. Update `skills/seaportal/SKILL.md` if a user-visible CLI flag changed.

## Architectural constraints

These constraints come from the project vision. Do not violate without
discussion:

- **No site-specific code.** Cross-cutting infrastructure (Cloudflare, the
  Wikidata edit-pencil pattern) is acceptable; per-host code is not.
- **HTTP-only.** No JS execution, no browser fallback. Escalate to pinchtab.
- **No LLM calls.** SeaPortal is *input* to LLMs, not a wrapper around them.
- **Sub-2s extraction** is the target for typical (non-pathological) inputs.

## Common tasks

- **Adding a new corpus fixture**: drop the HTML under `testdata/<class>/`
  (static / ssr / hydrated / dynamic / blocked / multilingual / etc.), add
  a `corpus.yaml` entry with `must_include` markers in the document's
  native script, run `./dev bench eval` to verify F1.
- **Adding a real-site assertion**: append to `tests/optimization/sites.tsv`
  with the observed `pageClass` (run `./seaportal --json <url>` first; never
  ship aspirational expectations). Re-run `./dev opt baseline` to confirm
  ≥85% overall pass rate.
- **Adding a new seabench subcommand**: mirror `cmd/seabench/classify.go`
  shape (subcommand file + test + main.go dispatch + printUsage line).
- **Adding a new fuzz harness**: append to `internal/engine/fuzz_test.go`,
  seed with 4-6 inputs (1-2 from real `testdata/`).
- **Running the agent self-test**: `./dev opt selftest` runs the curated
  10-task subset and emits completion-rate / avg-ops / escalation-correctness
  metrics. Replay-friendly via `seabench selftest --input <jsonl>`.
- **Releasing**: see `RELEASE.md`.

## Available `./dev` aliases

Beyond the table above:
- `./dev bench eval` — extraction quality bake-off (seaportal vs 3 baselines)
- `./dev bench classify` — page-class confusion matrix vs corpus labels
- `./dev bench tokens` — token-efficiency ratio per LinkRetention mode
- `./dev bench stress --preset quick|small|medium|large` — sustained throughput
- `./dev bench cachebench` — cache hit-rate + latency under mixed traffic
- `./dev bench diff` — pairwise output diff across cleanup variants
- `./dev opt baseline` — scripted real-site capability suite (`sites.tsv`)
- `./dev opt selftest` — agent-driven 10-task curated suite
